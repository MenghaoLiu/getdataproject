# Code book for the tidy data

## Introduction
This is a code book for the tidy data processed from [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), which were collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope of the Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone. The tidy data provides you the average of measurements on the mean and standard deviation for a specific activity and subject. Also, it has 180 observations and 68 variables, and you can access a formatted file named [finalData.csv](https://github.com/MenghaoLiu/getdataproject/blob/master/finalData.csv) for some details in this Github repository.
